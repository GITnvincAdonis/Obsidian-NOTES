UNITY GAMEDEV:
Successfully implemented moving platform. Platform looks for "IMoveable" items that has entered its trigger. It then calls the interface method, "MoveWithPlatform". When the Interface-able object leaves the trigger, the interface method, "RemoveFromPlatform", is called. Its a simple event based system

Also improved the ground checking ray casts, account for bounds of object, instead of only checking from center of player. Things feel a lot better to control.

NB. I had to disallow raycasts from interacting with triggers.
