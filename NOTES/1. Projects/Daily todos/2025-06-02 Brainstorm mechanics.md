Mechanics for Isometric 2d game:
- [[2025-06-08 pushing objects]] //
- teleporting //
- Moving Plats //
- Picking up //
- Interrupt jump when collide with object
- stomp
- Stop listening to inputs when paused (on player)//
  
3d approach
- Define a grid system for 3d (raycasting to predefined grid and using that coord)
- This will be for the 3objects
- Take a sprite and programmatically attach it to a 3d mesh
  
  
  ### orrrrr
-  Create the 3 object and sprite prefad. Of course of predefined styles
- Will need to iron out specfically how to properly cover 3d objects witj sprite
- It will be predictable, as sprites should be make predictably.
- Mesh joining system
  
  
  
ESSENTIALS:
Game play loop:
- menu
- level select
- pause menu
- settings menu
