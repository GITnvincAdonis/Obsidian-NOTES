> [!Question] What i learned today / General notes for the day

Atomic notes are preferred. Had a little argument with rowen about my stubbornness with adopting new tech, but at the end it indeed was smarter to heed his suggestions. Today was humiliating but necessary. Never underestimate what goes into your setup environment. Dotfiles are the way to go from now on.
