Fighting scope creep in game development is hard. After exploring ways of implementing of car controls, custom and using unity's built in physics, this mechanic will not be considered.

Its screams fun and dynamic and real challenge, i.e., scope. I am in favor of implementing a car suspension, steering and driving system, but in a game where it is the main mechanic.

In that project i will also tackle rigid-body controllers:
