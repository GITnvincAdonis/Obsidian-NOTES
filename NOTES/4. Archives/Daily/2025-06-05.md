Unity Development:

To mock continuous movements, remove from update loops. Instead an asynchronous workflow should be utilized (coroutines, async Awaits). Its cleaner and much more predictable as it is frame independent. 

My favorite movement library (dotween) uses this same concept.

Implemented:
- Moving platforms 
- Fixed the jump and character controller


> [!NOTE] Tomorrows todos

- Allow moving platform to displace any gameobject with a character controller or even a Rigid body.
  
  AND KEEP IN MIND, MOVEMENT IS NOT THE MAIN MECHANIC. WE WANT TO MAKE A PUZZLE GAME WITH MOVEMENT CAPABILITIES. stick to scope !!!!!.
