A list of items to be completed in a contract.
Required table format
- line Item 
- Item quantity
- Quoted line item 
- Price per unit
- Ext Price  (Quantity X unit price)
- Total

> [!Danger] Procedure
> 

- Using quote id, research on [SAM](https://sam.gov/)
- Gather documents from link.
- COmb through documents, using description. Use description to find goods. 
- Typically use lowest priced product that matches all requirements.
- In the request for quote, heuristics dictate that placing the sourced item image in the doc is preferred

Heuristics
- For quote documents from sam.gov, its beneficial to source all goods from one site to avoid multiple shipping dates and prices. 2 is acceptable, but still not ideal.

QUotes on SMA.gov has contracting officers, where questions and queries can be levied. 
The submission date and email address is provided on the site as well.


Purchase orders are also useful to pull item descriptions and codes

In case of products in quote description not having a public price, direct messaging for companies is required. 

- # direct messaging requires:
	
	- Sending emails template
	- address line: RFQ- Name of quote from sam.gov
	- shipping address
	- Items specific for company
	- Indicate whether requesting facility is tax exempt
	- Invite questions through email

Entire quote documents can be submitted to companies that have the goods. Use discernment, using documents that don't sell that AJs general contracting is the #middle_man . Documents can also be compiled from the purchase order into something stripped of jargon.

It should be easy for the goods company to ascertain what items are being price requested.
don't forget to follow up on company specific item prices (email that was sent)


NSN (Military request of quote)

On sam.gov, the NSN numbers are provided. Part numbers are also used. Use these numbers to query the following (NSN lookup, ISO group)
 
This is simply to find, as the goods are branded usually. 
Dont be ashamed to ask for discountsd (apply available discounts)

After submitting on NSN site, a follow up email is sent. The quote is also sent this way. 



When sending the emails, leave all information, but the signature can be changed to be personalized
