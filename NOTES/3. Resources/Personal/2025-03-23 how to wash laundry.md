> ##### 3. Stop machine from completing completing cycle
> ##### 4. Repeat for all piles
 
### Sorting Clothes
Clothes are sorted by the following:
- Attire purpose ( house or 'going-out')
- Color (each within own pile)
- Whites
- Blacks
This is to prevent fabric dye transfer between articles of clothes. Whites are also prepared separated with the use of bleach. Washing whites with others means the bleaching of those other fabrics.

### Operating Machine
The current machine will automatically detect the load, and if its too light, starting the machine will drain the water. So based on the load, enough water needs to be used.
